## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the "Mentor's API" project, which serves as a backend service for fetching mentor data from a PostgreSQL database. The API allows clients to retrieve information about mentors, including their name, image, rating, role, course, and years of experience.

## Project Overview
The "Mentor's API" project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to access mentor information. It can be integrated into various applications such as educational platforms, mentorship platforms, or any service that requires mentor data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before setting up and running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed
- PostgreSQL database configured

## 1. Install project dependencies:
    cd mentors-api
    npm install
## 2. Configure the database connection by modifying the .env file.

## 3. Start the API server:
    npm start

# Project Structure
The project structure follows a standard Node.js application structure and includes the following key directories and files:

- app.js: The main application file.
- controllers/: Contains controller functions for handling API requests.
- models/: Defines the data models for the database.
- routes/: Defines API routes and connects them to controller functions.
- config/: Stores configuration files, including database configuration.
- middlewares/: Contains custom middleware functions.
- public/: Stores static assets (e.g., mentor images).
- tests/: Includes test scripts and test data.
  
# Database Schema
The PostgreSQL database schema for mentor data includes the following tables:
- mentors: Stores mentor information (name, image, rating, role, course, experience).
